# Welcome to my Dashboard!

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation 

I was interested in building a dashboard. I went with building the frontend with Chakra UI and Next.js. 

Feel free to [reach out](https://abneuro.vercel.app/contact) to me if you have any additional questions. There are lots of features that still need to be implemented!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
